One of Bubble's most significant advantages is its ability to streamline the app development process. Its drag-and-drop interface, coupled with a visual design canvas, empowers users to bring their concepts to life effortlessly. It eliminates the need for intricate coding, allowing creators to focus on the core functionalities and features of their apps rather than grappling with complex programming languages.
However, this simplicity, while a strength for many, can also be a limitation for those seeking a highly customized and intricate app. The range of specific elements and customization options may not cater to the needs of projects demanding a unique and tailored user experience. For instance, if you're aiming for a highly specialized app with intricate design requirements or advanced functionality, you might find Bubble's offerings somewhat restrictive.
The system and layout that Bubble offers are friendly and have simplified the process of creating an app. However, due to its simple nature, it lacks an extensive range of specific elements and customization.
